# Roller Champions Tracker
This is a stat tracker for the Ubisoft title Roller Champions.
It's still a work in progress.

Huge thanks to Nuntax for providing so much help and information.

# Known issues
-The values for global stats are almost always wrong when compared to adding the stats from the other 3 modes. I might fix this soon by opting to add the 3 values instead of using globals

-Multiple Switch users can have the same username, when looking up a popular name in Switch, it's possible to get back hundreds if not thousands of profiles back, and there is no way to know which is the intended profile. I have no idea on how to approach this problem.
